Create an app that will allow users to wager on the price movements of the three top market cap cryptocurrencies.
The "wager card" will need to be in the format of a table with 4 rows.
The 4 rows should be labeled the following:
"Wager Amount"
"Wager Multiplier"
"Potential Winnings"
"Place Wager"

First, users will need to be able to type in the exact wager amount into the "Wager Amount" field using only USDC or Solana tokens
-This field will be the Amount of the Wager placed by the user

Secondly, user will be required to choose a "Wager Multiplier"
-This field will be partially used to populate the row "Potential Winnings"
	The calculation used to populate the "Potential Winnings" field will be as follows:
		"Wager Amount" * "Wager Multiplier" = "Potential Winnings"
-The "Wager Multiplier" field should be a drop down menu with the following options to choose:

1x
2x
3x
5x

The number in front of the "x" represents the amount the "Wager Amount" needs to be multiplied by. So if a user chose 3x for their "Wager Multiplier" and their "Wager Amount" was $10 USDC, the "Potential Winnings" would equal $30 USDC

The last row would be to "Place Wager"
-This function would submit the wager to be officially placed so the website could track it progress to determine if the wager wins or loses
-Also each wager once placed will have exactly 1 hour time to either win or lose
	There should be a countdown timer displayed boldly in the "wager card" once the wager is submitted so the user knows exactly how much time is left for their wager to win or lose
	There also needs to be another field directly next to the countdown timer which will be populated with the "wager price target"
		The "wager price target" will be calculated by the following formula:
			("Current Price of Cryptocurrency") * percentage associated with ("Wager Multiplier") 
				For reference here are the percentages associated with the "Wager Multiplier"
					1x = 1.5% increase over ("Current Price of Cryptocurrency")
					2x = 2% increase over ("Current Price of Cryptocurrency")
					3x = 2.5% increase over ("Current Price of Cryptocurrency")
					5x = 3% increase over ("Current Price of Cryptocurrency")

How to determine if a wager "wins" or "loses"?

A user will 

1st choose the amount they wish to wager by typing the amount into the "Wager Amount" field

2nd choose the "Wager Multiplier" they wish to use for their wager

3rd - the website will auto-populate the field to show the user their "Potential Winnings" for the wager if currently submitted

4th Once the wager is submitted the "wager price target" field will be populated by calculating the following formula
	("Current Price of Cryptocurrency") * percentage associated with ("Wager Multiplier") 


The site will also need to store the information submitted for each wager to reference once the wager is complete.
